# FFmpeg Binaries

Place FFmpeg binaries here for production builds.

## Required Files (Windows)
- `ffmpeg.exe`
- `ffprobe.exe`

## Download
Download FFmpeg from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

For Windows, you can get pre-built binaries from:
- https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases (recommended)
- https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Download the "essentials" or "full" build and extract `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` to this folder.
